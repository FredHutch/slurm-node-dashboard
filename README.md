# HPC Dashboard

This repository contains the source code for the HPC Dashboard, a Next.js application designed to monitor the status of SLURM nodes. The dashboard provides comprehensive utilization metrics for both CPU and GPU nodes, along with detailed statuses for individual nodes. Additionally, you can search for individual users and their jobs.

## Features

- View total utilization of CPU and GPU nodes.
- Search for Users to see their current jobs.
- Search for Jobs to see its current status.
- Individual node status with details on CPU, GPU, and memory usage.
- Styled with Shadcn and Tailwind CSS.
- Built with Next.js.

## Prerequisites

### Note: Docker was the preferred way to install this application, but recently I have been experiencing issues with timeouts while using Docker, which I no longer encountered when running with PM2 natively. I've left the Docker instructions but recommend using PM2 natively for the time being.

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v18 or later)
- Yarn or npm
- PM2
- Docker (optional)
- SLURM API enabled on your HPC cluster
- SLURM API token for authentication

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thediymaker/slurm-node-dashboard.git
cd slurm-node-dashboard
```

### Install dependencies

```
npm install
```
```
dnf install pm2
or
apt install pm2
```

### Run the application with PM2

```
pm2 start npm --name "slurm-node-dashboard" -- start
```

The application should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your `.env` file.

```plaintext
COMPANY_NAME=""
URL=""
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=""
VERSION="1.1.2"
CLUSTER_NAME=""
CLUSTER_LOGO="logo.png"

NODE_ENV="production"
REACT_EDITOR="code"

SLURM_API_VERSION="v0.0.40"
SLURM_SERVER=""
SLURM_API_TOKEN=""
```

**You will also need to make sure you place your logo.png in the plublic directory, as well as replace the default favicon.ico with your own.**


## Docker Configuration (Optional) - Currently not the recommended install method

Here's a brief overview of the Docker setup:

- **Base Image:** Uses `node:18-alpine` for a lightweight container.
- **Dependencies:** Installs project dependencies selectively based on the presence of a lock file.
- **Building:** Compiles the Next.js project.
- **Running:** Uses a non-root user for improved security.

Refer to the `Dockerfile` in the repository for detailed configuration.


### Build the Docker image

```bash
docker build -t slurm-node-dashboard .
```

### Run the Docker container

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 slurm-node-dashboard
```
