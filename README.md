# HPC Dashboard

This repository contains the source code for the HPC Dashboard, a Next.js application designed to monitor the status of SLURM nodes. The dashboard provides total utilization metrics for CPU and GPU nodes, as well as detailed statuses for individual nodes. This application is built using well known packages, and styled with tailwindcss and Shadcn components

## Standard Features

- View total utilization of CPU and GPU nodes.
- Individual node status with details on CPU, GPU, and memory usage.
- View Slurm job details.

## Optional Features

The optional features will be enabled by adding the detailst to the environments file. If these are left blank, the intergration will not show up, but the rest of the application will continue to function correctly.

- LMOD module details
- Prometheus integration
- InfluxDB intergration
- OpenAI intergration

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- Yarn or npm
- Slurm API enabled on your HPC cluster
- Slurm API token for authentication

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thediymaker/slurm-node-dashboard.git
cd slurm-node-dashboard
```

### Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

```
dnf install pm2
or
apt install pm2
```

### Run the application with PM2

```
pm2 start npm --name "slurm-node-dashboard" -- start
```

The application should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your `.env` file.

```plaintext
COMPANY_NAME=""
URL=""
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=""
CLUSTER_NAME=""
CLUSTER_LOGO="/logo.png"

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLUSTER_NAME=""

PROMETHEUS_URL=""
INFLUX_TOKEN=""
INFLUX_URL=""
INFLUX_ORG=""

OPENAI_API_KEY=""

NODE_ENV="production"
REACT_EDITOR="code"

SLURM_API_VERSION="v0.0.40"
SLURM_SERVER=""
SLURM_API_TOKEN=""
```

**You will also need to make sure you place your logo.png in the plublic directory, as well as replace the default favicon.ico with your own.**

## Collecting node data in JSON format, for use with the "Historical" node status module.

In order to capture the data for use with the historical module, you need to create a script that pulls down the node data on an hourly basis, here is an example script, that you would then call hourly via cron.

```
#!/bin/bash

# Set the timezone
export TZ='America/Phoenix'

# Set the directory where you want to save the JSON files
SAVE_DIR="/var/www/beta_dashboard/data"

# Ensure the save directory exists
mkdir -p "$SAVE_DIR"

# Generate the filename with the current date and time
FILENAME=$(date +"%Y-%m-%dT%H-%M-%S.000Z.json.gz")

# Fetch the data and save it to the file
curl -s "http://localhost:3000/api/slurm/nodes" | gzip > "$SAVE_DIR/$FILENAME"

# Optional: Keep only the last 30 days of data
find "$SAVE_DIR" -name "*.json.gz" -type f -mtime +30 -delete
```

## Collecting module data in JSON format, for use with the "Modules" module.

In order to collect the JSON data for the modules page, you will need to create this script and call it on any cadence you see fit. This will overwrite the existing modules.json.

```
#!/bin/bash

# Set output variables
json_dir="/var/www/beta_dashboard/data"
json_output="${json_dir}/modules.json"

# Create json directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p "$json_dir"

# Set environment variables - this will likely change for you
export MODULESHOME="/usr/share/lmod/lmod"
export MODULEPATH="/packages/modulefiles/apps:/packages/modulefiles/spack"

# Run the spider command and save JSON output
$LMOD_DIR/spider -o jsonSoftwarePage $MODULEPATH | python -m json.tool > "$json_output"
```
